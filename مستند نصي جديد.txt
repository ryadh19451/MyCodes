write down what you want
stop listen to stupid music ,people and anything stupid
create a mind movie and look at it every morning and night
listen to a guided meditation
repeat positive affirmations
show gratitude for the smallest things
do the works towards the goal
be patient and prepared
beleive that you deserve it
want it as bad as you want to breathe
